Q1. What are various ways to add images into our App? Explain with code examples.
Ans. There are multiple ways to add images into our app :
    1. from src folder(generally used for react applications) : we can store our file inside components/assests/image.png and then we can import it in our code 
    2. from public folder : this is used to store our image in a public folder and this can be used inside our app using relative path 
    3. using CDN : this is best way to use images inside our apps because this allows us to directly use images URL from sever to display an image on our app.
    4. using CSS : we can also use image inside our app by using css and we can use this image as background to our app
    5. using dynamic methods :  we can also use props to add images into our app dynamically as this allows use of APIs and props.

Q2. What would happen if we do console.log(useState())?
Ans. when useState() is console.log inside a functional component without any initial value then it displays an array containing the current state of the component i.e. undefined and a function to update the state i.e. 'f'.
However if we console.log useState() outside a functional component then it will throw an error since it cant be used without a component state.

Q3.How will useEffect behave if we don't add a dependency array ?
Ans. useEffect() hook takes a dependency array as an argument that contains elements such that whenever that elements changes the callback function inside the useEffect() hook executes. If we do not give a dependency array then there will be no use of useEffect() hook since there is no element to be dependent on to call the callback function. However if we pass an empty array as a dependency array then the page re-renders everytime the state of any component changes and the callback function is executed on every render.

Q4. What is SPA?
Ans. SPA stands for Single Page Application. This is created using React library and this one contains only one HTML page and it uses client side and dynamic routing to update the pages depending upon the routes without reloading the whole page. This provides a faster and smooth experience to users.
