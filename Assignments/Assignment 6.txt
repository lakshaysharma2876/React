Q1. What is the difference between Named Export, Default export and * as export?
Ans. Named export is a feature of JavaScript that allows you to use a specific function/ element from a library or module to directly be imported in your current file using { }. You have to mention against the elements or functions the keyword 'export' to use this .
Default export allows you to import the function/elements using 'default' keyword. These can be imported without mentioning {} in the current file and there is no need to use export keyword while making a default export at the function/element
* as export allows you to export all the functionalities of the module/package/ library as a variable which can later be used to invoke functionalities of the module using . operator

Eg : import React from "react";    //default import 
      import { createElement } from "react-dom";  //named import
      import * as React from "react"   // * as import
